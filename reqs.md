WHY - VISION & PURPOSE
* What problem are you solving and for whom?:
    * This document proposes a software platform that will empower a robot or digital assistant to provide automated, intelligent support to a family. The platform will orchestrate the interaction of 
features offered by large language models (LLMs) with more traditional software application logic
* What does your application do?:
    * The platform will assist families with tasks and responsibilities across categories such as:
      * Household management
      * Calendar and scheduling
      * Financial management
      * Health and wellness
      * Education and learning
      * Transportation and logistics
      * Social planning
      * Entertainment and leisure
      * Personal and professional development
      * Technology assistance
      * Emergency preparedness
      * Pet care
* Who will use it?:
    * The primary users are owners of a robot or digital assistant that they use to perform tasks.
* Why will they use it instead of alternatives?: 
    * Although the platform will sound similar to products such as Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, and more advanced chatbots, some benefits of this products include: the open source emphasis and no subscription costs, the private hosting of data for privacy and security concerns.
WHAT - CORE REQUIREMENTS
* What must your application do?:
    * User will be able to interact with the platform using voice as well as through mobile and web applications.
    * The system will persist conversations with users to support context-aware follow-up conversations and support.
    * The system will be able to perform many digital workflows related to communication, calendar management, knowledge support, etc.
* What actions need to happen?:
    * The platform will assist families with tasks and responsibilities across categories such as:
      * Household management
      * Calendar and scheduling
      * Financial management
      * Health and wellness
      * Education and learning
      * Transportation and logistics
      * Social planning
      * Entertainment and leisure
      * Personal and professional development
      * Technology assistance
      * Emergency preparedness
      * Pet care
* What should the outcomes be?:
    * The system will support the use cases to the best of its ability.
    * The system will iterate with the user as necessary in order to succesfully accomplish each use case.
HOW - PLANNING & IMPLEMENTATION
* What are the required stack components?:
    * Relational database for structured data
    * Non-relational database for semi-structured data
    * Vector database to support RAG-related use cases
    * Code API built using node.js
    * Application front end using React or similar library
    * Library and language to support interactive voice-first application integration
* What are the system requirements?:
    *  The application will be supported on a high-end home computer such as a Macbook Pro M4 with 32 GB memory.
    *  The application may require lower-Nvidia devices such as teh DGX Spark for LLM processes.
* What are the key user flows?:
    * The user may requests reviewing or sending of email
    * The user may requests reveiwing or sending of SMS messages
    * The user may ask the system for help related to general knowledge, cooking, home repair, visual and audio object identification (requires visual and audio capabilities of the device), etc
* What are the core interfaces?:
    * The core interfaces involve interactive voice and mobile/web applications.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
* What are your access and authentication needs?:
    * Access to the web and mobile applications will require user authentication
    * Voice interaction may require authentication with sensitive data is involved.
* What business rules must be followed?: 
    * The application will not share personal and private information to external sources without explicit consent from authorized users.
* What are your implementation priorities?:
    * The highest priority features are those that involve utility value to the end user (calendar, email, knowledge integrations).
